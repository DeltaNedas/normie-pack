You might be wondering, "Why have a safety lever at all?"
The short answer is: "for safety, duh."
The long answer is something like:
	If there are any bugs in the fissctl program, there could be a heat leak.
	This is like a memory leak in the sense that over time, some gained
	heat is not accounted for. This leads to a rise in heat that over time causes a meltdown. If a reactor operator notices that the
	reactor is leaking heat, they can hit the safety lever and let the heat dissipate, avoiding catastrophe.
	Another reason to have it is to launch fissctl exactly when you want as to not waste any fuel.
